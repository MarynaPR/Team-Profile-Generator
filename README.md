 ## Description

 This code showcases a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person in a software engineering team. It provides well-crafted testing for each part of the code and ensures that is passes all unit tests.
 Your application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.
